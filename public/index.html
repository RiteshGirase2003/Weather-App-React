      content="This Weather App is a comprehensive weather forecasting application developed using React.js. The app provides hyperlocal weather data, including minute forecasts, historical data, and various weather conditions for any location on the globe. Note :- This Weather App project is developed purely for educational purposes. It is not intended for commercial use or as a substitute for professional weather forecasting services. The data provided by this app is sourced from the OpenWeather API, and while efforts have been made to ensure accuracy, no guarantee is made for the reliability or timeliness of the information. Users are encouraged to consult official weather sources for critical decisions or activities where accuracy is paramount."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
